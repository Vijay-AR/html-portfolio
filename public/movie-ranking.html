<h1>The best movies according to Vijay</h1>
<p><h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</p></h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Intersterllar</h3>
<p>The reason I love this movie is because it talks about several things that are interesting to me and brings joy to me and also I love the fact that it is a movie about space since space is something that brings great intrigue to me and therefore ranks high up in my favourite movies.</p>
<h3>OMG 2</h3>
<p>OMG 2 is one of my favourite movies as it talks about a very untalked topic and sheds light on things that are not talked about as frequently as they should be in society. It is a bold movie that everyone must see.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Another one of my favourites, Oppenheimer delivers  on several levels and is a masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. He never fails to deliver and he does it again. This movie talks about the production of the atom bomb and is a biopic of James Oppenheimer.</p>
